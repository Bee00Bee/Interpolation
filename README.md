### Interpolation

Interpolation is a useful method to find the trend of experimental data when there are not enough data points. 

The two '.m' files in this repository are used to find the trend of the data. The files are:
* fit_power_n.m
* Interpolation.m

You can check this line of code: ft = fittype( 'power2' ); in fit_power_n.m file where you can specify the order of the interpolation.  


### Required Softwares:

or you can use:

* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
